## Questions
- I spent two days on the task. Due to lack of time, the design is badly implemented, there are small amount of validations, few notoriously bad quick fixes and not done monthly dashboard.
- SwiftUI is a cool thing. I tried to show a few tricks from there, such as creating layout using stack and builders, or using decorators for UIView. 
- We can use analytical services for this. Or use the basic organizer that comes with Xcode. 
- The best thing is to do competent logging, and make it a cult of the team. Also, you can use third-party software such as Postman, for example. 
- Style consistency is not used for API. The password is not sent in encrypted form. The backend does not provide any tools for field validation. Frontend shouldn't do sorting.
