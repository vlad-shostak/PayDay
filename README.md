# PayDay

- Project name: PayDay
- Language: Swift 5
- Design pattern: VIPER

## Questions
- I spent two days on the task. Due to lack of time, the design is badly implemented, there are small amount of validations, and a few notoriously bad quick fixes.
- SwiftUI is a cool thing. I tried to show a few tricks from there, such as creating layout using stack and builders, or using decorators for UIView. 
- We can use analytical services for this. Or use the basic organizer that comes with Xcode. 
- The best thing is to do competent logging, and make it a cult of the team. Also, you can use third-party software such as Postman, for example. 
- Style consistency is not used for API. The password is not sent in encrypted form. The backend does not provide any tools for field validation.
